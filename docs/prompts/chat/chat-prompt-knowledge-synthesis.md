I'd like you to synthesize the knowledge in my Zettelkasten on the following topic or question:

[TOPIC OR QUESTION]

As you work:

1. Use the tools to discover all related notes, following links and tags recursively
2. Identify the key concepts and how they connect to each other
3. Synthesize this information into a comprehensive response that:
   - Addresses my topic/question directly
   - Integrates ideas from multiple notes
   - Identifies patterns and insights across notes
   - Highlights any contradictions or gaps
   - Suggests potential new connections or areas for exploration

4. Include explicit references to the note IDs you're drawing from (e.g., "As noted in 202101010001...")

5. At the end of your response, suggest how I might:
   - Improve the organization of these notes
   - Fill important knowledge gaps
   - Create new structure notes if needed
   - Consider exporting this knowledge as a standalone collection using `zk_export_knowledge_base`

Please structure your response to build understanding progressively, starting with foundational concepts and moving to more complex ideas.
