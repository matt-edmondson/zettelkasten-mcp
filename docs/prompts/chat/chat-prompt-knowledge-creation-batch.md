I've attached a larger text/collection of information to process into my Zettelkasten. Please:

1. First identify main themes and check my existing system for related notes and tags

2. Extract 5-10 distinct atomic ideas from this material, organized into logical clusters
   - Eliminate any concepts that duplicate my existing notes
   - Process each validated concept into a note with appropriate type, title, tags, and content
   - Create connections between related notes in this batch
   - Connect each new note to relevant existing notes in my system

3. Update or create structure notes as needed to integrate this batch of knowledge

4. Verify quality for each note:
   - Each note contains a single focused concept
   - All sources are properly cited
   - Each note has meaningful connections
   - Terminology is consistent with my existing system

Provide a summary of all notes created, connections established, and structure notes updated, along with any areas you've identified for follow-up work.

Remember to leverage the batch operations tools for efficient processing:
- When creating multiple notes at once
- When establishing connections between notes
- When searching multiple terms in one operation
