I've attached a larger text/collection of information to process into my Zettelkasten. Please:

1. First identify main themes and check my existing system for related notes and tags
   - Use `zk_search_notes` and `zk_get_all_tags` to understand my existing knowledge base
   - Consider using `zk_batch_search_by_text` for efficiently searching multiple key terms at once

2. Extract 5-10 distinct atomic ideas from this material, organized into logical clusters
   - Eliminate any concepts that duplicate my existing notes
   - Process each validated concept into a note with appropriate type, title, tags, and content
   - Create connections between related notes in this batch
   - Connect each new note to relevant existing notes in my system
   - Use `zk_batch_create_notes` to efficiently create all notes at once

3. Update or create structure notes as needed to integrate this batch of knowledge
   - After creating notes, use `zk_batch_create_links` to establish all connections efficiently

4. Verify quality for each note:
   - Each note contains a single focused concept
   - All sources are properly cited
   - Each note has meaningful connections
   - Terminology is consistent with my existing system

Provide a summary of all notes created, connections established, and structure notes updated, along with any areas you've identified for follow-up work.

Remember to leverage the batch operations tools for efficient processing:
- `zk_batch_create_notes` for creating multiple notes at once
- `zk_batch_create_links` for establishing connections between notes
- `zk_batch_search_by_text` for searching multiple terms in one operation
